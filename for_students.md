This is the 'Dutch by Kids' page for students.

## What is this course?

This is the website of 'Dutch By Kids' course.
In this course, you can meet up with Dutch kids using Discord.

The free course is taught by 
[De Jonge Onderzoekers Groningen](https://www.djog.nl).

How cool is that, to both practice your Dutch and help Dutch
in spending their evening in a useful and gezellige way!

## How can I follow the lessons?

We teach using Discord, an online chat and voice platform used
mostly for gaming. Or: it's the platform the teachers use :+1:

To start, you will need to 

 * install Discord from [https://discordapp.com](https://discordapp.com)
 * create an account
 * send a Friend Request to Richel: `richelbilderbeek#9002`

Then, you'll be invited to the 'De Jonge Onderzoekers' server.

## How does a lesson take place (for students, thus Enlish)?

Lessons take place on Wednesdays from 18:15 to 20:00.

When you arrive at 'De Grote Tafel' ('The Big Table'), say hello
to the people there! There, you'll be taken to smaller tables.

See this YouTube video: [TODO]

We follow this timetable:

What             | Time
-----------------|------
Doors open       | 18:00
Lesson starts    | 18:15
Break time!      | 19:00
Lesson continues | 19:15
End of lesson    | 20:00

What we do in the break is still a surprise :grin:

## FAQ

### What can I learn here?

That is mostly up to you, the adult, to decide.
If you have a microphone, you can try an informal conversation.
In any case, you can try to practice your Dutch written conversation using
the text channels.

The kids are -unsurprisingly- no full professional teachers. 
But they will enjoy helping, so we predict it will work out as
something fun!

### I struggle with my teacher, what should I do?

Send a private message to `richelbilderbeek`, he'll invite you back
to 'De Grote Tafel' ('The Big Table') and we'll find some solution, possible
another student.

### I want to arrive later, is that OK?

Sure, that's fine :+1:

### I want to leave later, is that OK?

Sure, that's fine :+1:

### I need help!

Sure:

 * Send a private message on Discord
 * If you cannot get on Discord, send me an email: `richel@richelbilderbeek.nl`
